            <h2>What's this about?</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a big fan of CSS code golf. I play it
              <a href="https://cssbattle.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                >here</a
              >. If I score in the top 10, I'll write about it. In the beginning I'll explain a lot, but won't re-explain a trick that I've already explained.
							Here are some general tips though:
							<ul>
								<li>Minify everything</li>
								<li>Find the shortest possible unit. This means:
									<ul>
										<li>Dropping the unit altogether for some properties like margin and padding. Eg: margin: 5; instead of margin: 5px;</li>
										<li>20px = 5vw</li>
										<li>40px = 5ch</li>

									</ul>
									Everything else you should try use percentage or q value usually. Q is a bit less than a px. So 10px = 11Q, and 50px = 54q roughly. You'll have to play with the values.
								</li>
							</ul>
