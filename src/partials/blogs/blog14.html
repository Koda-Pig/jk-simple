    <strong>Breakdown:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    OK this was a cool one. I really enjoy challenges like this - a good balance
    of complexity, and not a problem best solved using only gradients (which
    gets a bit boring imo). I used a dotted border to create the 3 top dots
    (html element) and single bottom dot (body element). Used a radial gradient
    to draw the half circle, and fill in the orange background.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to take a bit of a deeper look at the radial gradient in this
    solution though, as it was revealed that there was a lot I could have done
    to optimize this. Looking at the background shorthand code again:
    <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <script data-no-format>`background:radial-gradient(1q at 50%0,#F3AC3C 5ch,#000 0 5pc,#F3AC3C)50%111%/300%109%`</script>
    </span>
    We have here:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A circular radial gradient (1q) positioned at 50% on the x-axis and 0 on
      the y-axis. Note that this could be shortened by one character to
      <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <script data-no-format>`1q at top`</script>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      A gradient with 2 colors (orange and black) and hard stops at 40px (5ch)
      and 80px (5pc).
    </li>
    <li>A background size of 300% on the x-axis and 109% on the y-axis.</li>
    <li>A background position of 50% on the x-axis and 111% on the y-axis</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is a decent illustration of the sheer power of gradients in CSS. They
    are an essential tool in any CSS Battlers toolbelt.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Here are the styles, unminified:</strong></p>
  <div class="code" lang="css">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script data-no-format>
`* {
  border-top: 5ch dotted;
  margin: 25%120;
  * {
    margin: 80 60;
    background: radial-gradient(1Q at 50%0, #f3ac3c 5ch, #000 0 5pc, #f3ac3c)
      50%111%/300%109%;
  }
}`
</script>
  </div>
