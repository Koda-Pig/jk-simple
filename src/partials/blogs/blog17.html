    <strong>Breakdown:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The HTML element doesn't do much in this solution (other than have some
    margin applied to it), the heavy lifting is done by the body element and two
    image elements. The box shadow property is used to create the 3 horizontal
    bars on each section. Padding is used for the img elements to set their
    size, margin for positioning and then rotate for obvious reasons.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is one interesting trick used in this solution that I've learned to do
    recently: using a single margin property to position two elements. My old
    method of positioning two elements with margin would be:
  </p>

  <div class="code" lang="css">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script data-no-format>`img { margin: 20 50; + * { margin: 35 100 } }`</script>
  </div>

  <p>
    That method sets the margin on img elements, then uses the adjacent sibling
    selector to target its next sibling and apply different margin there. The
    new method uses a single margin property, with a very high negative value,
    to position both images exactly where they need to be. This results in the
    element that appears first in the DOM, appearing to render last visually.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Here are the styles, unminified:</strong></p>
  <div class="code" lang="css">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script data-no-format>
`* {
  background: #3a335a;
  margin: 0 65 135;
  * {
    color: fff;
    box-shadow: 0 65px, 0 45vh, 0 217Q;
    * {
      margin: 5-545-5 135;
      padding: 15 70;
      rotate: -15deg;
      + * {
        rotate: 15deg;
      }
    }
  }
}`
</script>
  </div>
