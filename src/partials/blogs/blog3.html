    <script>`<style>*{background:radial-gradient(1q,#5A9F48 25vw,#282828 0 130px,#5A9F48)0%100%/100%762q;*{margin:60 150-190`</script>

    <strong>Breakdown:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    No extra markup was added in this challenge, only used the html and body
    elements that are already on the page. My plan with this challenge was to
    create 2 circles with the same background. The shortest way I know this can
    be done is with a radial gradient as a background image. I'll break down
    each part of the background rule, seeing as it's the only rule other than
    the margin used for positioning the body element.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong
      >Here is the background shorthand rule, broken up into it's parts:</strong
    >
  </p>
  <div class="code" lang="css">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script>
`background-image: radial-gradient(1q, rgb(90, 159, 72) 25vw, rgb(40, 40, 40) 0px, rgb(40, 40, 40) 130px, rgb(90, 159, 72));
background-position-x: 0%;
background-position-y: 100%;
background-size: 100% 762q;
background-repeat: initial;
background-attachment: initial;
background-origin: initial;
background-clip: initial;
background-color: initial;`
</script>
  </div>

  <p>
    So the first part is the background image where we have a radial gradient,
    and the first part of that is the
    <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <script>`1q`</script>
    </span>
    . This is the
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient#ending-shape"
      target="_blank"
      >shape</a
    >
    of the gradient. Instead of putting
    <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <script>`circle`</script> </span
    >, we can save a few characters by using the length value instead. As
    mentioned on the MDN page linked above:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>
      When the
      <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <script>`<ending-shape>`</script>
      </span>
      keyword is omitted, the gradient shape is determined by the size given.
      One
      <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <script>`<length>`</script>
      </span>
      value provides a circle, while two values in
      <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <script>`<length-percentage>`</script>
      </span>
      units provide an ellipse. A single
      <span class="code code-inline" lang="css">
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <script>`<percentage>`</script>
      </span>
      value is not valid.
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, we have the gradient code, which uses hard stops to give a solid gray
    circle on a green background. Then we have the position x and y which is
    self explanatory. The last important part of this is the background size.
    I've made this larger than the viewport height, to prevent the circle of the
    background from being repeated. The alternative to achieving this is giving
    it a background attachment of fixed (more characters), or setting the
    background size to be smaller than the viewport (which won't work because it
    cuts of the green background).

  <p><strong>Here are the styles, unminified:</strong></p>
  <div class="code" lang="css">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script>
`* {
  background: radial-gradient(1Q, #5a9f48 25vw, #282828 0 130px, #5a9f48) 0%100%/100%762q;
  * {
    margin: 60 150-190;
  }
}`
</script>
  </div>
