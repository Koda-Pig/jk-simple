  <p>Solution (107 characters):</p>
  <div class="code" data-lang="html">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script data-no-format>`<style>*{background:#4763B1}&{*{margin:39;rotate:45deg}margin:91 141;border-image:69/42%conic-gradient(#fff`</script>
  </div>

    I was pretty happy with this solution. Really thought I had gotten it as
    short as possible, before I saw the top scorers. The border-image property
    was used to make up the four white squares, and the body makes up the center
    blue shape overlaying the four white squares.
  </p>

  <p>
    I missed something obvious with this challenge though, instead of using a
    second element to create the blue shape in the middle, it's actually
    possible to create that shape using only the border image property. I used a
    conic gradient with a solid white color, but if a radial gradient is used
    instead, the entire image can be created like this:

  <div class="code" data-lang="html">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script data-no-format>`<body bgcolor=4763B style=margin:91+141;border-image:60/42%radial-gradient(#0000+8q,#FFF+0>`</script>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Here are the styles, unminified:</strong></p>
  <div class="code" data-lang="css">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <script data-no-format>
`* {
  background: #4763b1;
}
& {
  * {
    margin: 39;
    rotate: 45deg;
  }
  margin: 91 141;
  border-image: 69/42%conic-gradient(#fff);
}`
</script>
  </div>
